### Key Questions:
- How have popular genres shifted over time?  
- What genres consistently perform well critically (e.g., Oscars) versus commercially (e.g., box office revenue)?  
- Are there genre-specific trends tied to social, economic, or technological factors?

### Analysis Steps:
- **Data Analysis**: Examine box office and critical reception data (e.g., IMDb scores, Metascores) by genre across decades.
- **Visualizations**: Create graphs showing genre popularity trends over time (e.g., percentage of total movies or revenue by genre).
- **Correlation Study**: Assess if certain genres thrive in specific eras (e.g., sci-fi in technological booms).

### Deliverables:
- Heatmap or line charts of genre trends over decades.
- Case study of specific genres (e.g., rise of superhero movies or resurgence of horror in the 2010s).

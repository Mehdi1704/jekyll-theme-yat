### Objective:
Develop an interactive tool to predict critical and commercial success based on key movie attributes.

### Tool Features:
- **Input Variables**: Genre, budget, release date, cast, director, runtime, etc.  
- **Predictions**: Box office revenue, critical ratings, potential awards.  
- **Visual Feedback**: Show real-time probability graphs or comparative stats for hypothetical movies.

### Steps to Develop:
1. **Model Training**: Use machine learning algorithms trained on historical movie datasets.
2. **Web Interface**: Build a user-friendly web app for interactive predictions.
3. **Custom Insights**: Allow users to test "what-if" scenarios (e.g., changing actors, budgets, or release timing).

### Deliverables:
- Deployed interactive predictor.
- Sample predictions with commentary on why certain combinations work.

### Additional Considerations
- **Data Sources**: Leverage public datasets like IMDb, TMDb, and Box Office Mojo for historical data.
- **Ethical Analysis**: Discuss how biases in data (e.g., gender or racial disparities) might influence trends and outcomes.
- **Audience Engagement**: Use engaging visuals and storytelling to make findings relatable (e.g., comparisons to popular modern films).

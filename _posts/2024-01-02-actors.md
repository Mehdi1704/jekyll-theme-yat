### Key Questions:
- How does casting (actors, producers, directors) influence a movie’s success?  
- Is there a measurable "star power" effect?

### Analysis Steps:
- **Actor Influence**: Correlate actors’ presence with box office earnings and critical acclaim. Explore trends by decade (e.g., the rise of franchises built around stars like Tom Cruise or Dwayne Johnson).
- **Producer Influence**: Analyze the role of major producers/studios (e.g., Disney, Marvel Studios).
- **Collaboration Networks**: Map collaborations between actors, directors, and producers to identify patterns.

### Deliverables:
- Actor "star power" ranking based on success metrics.
- Network graph of major collaborations in the industry.

### The Symbiotic Relationship Between Cult Movies and Characters

**Key Question**: How do iconic characters contribute to the long-term success and cultural impact of cult movies, and in turn, how do cult movies elevate these characters into timeless symbols of popular culture?

The relationship between cult movies and their iconic characters is deeply symbiotic, with each elevating the other to cultural prominence. Memorable characters, such as antiheroes, underdogs, or sympathetic villains, often become the driving force behind a film's enduring appeal, capturing audience imagination long after the credits roll. In turn, the cult movie itself serves as a platform that amplifies these characters, allowing them to transcend the screen and become cultural symbols. For example, The Dark Knight’s Joker and Fight Club’s Tyler Durden are more than just characters—they embody societal anxieties, rebellion, or moral complexity, resonating with audiences across generations. This interplay between story, character, and audience ensures that cult films and their figures remain relevant and iconic for years to come.

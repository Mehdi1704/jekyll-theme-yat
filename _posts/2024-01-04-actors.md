### Introduction
The presence of a star actor, a visionary director, or a renowned producer can make or break a movie. Over the decades, "star power" has played a pivotal role in shaping box office earnings and critical acclaim. But how has this influence evolved over time? From the golden age of Hollywood to the era of franchises and shared universes, the impact of casting and collaboration remains central to cinematic success.

In this article, we analyze the measurable effects of star power, the influence of major studios, and the intricate networks of collaboration between actors, directors, and producers.
